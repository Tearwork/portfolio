<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome! I am a dedicated professional with a unique blend of expertise in Archaeology and Data Science. Holding a degree in Archaeology and a second-level Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Statistical Learning, I specialize in applying deep learning techniques to archaeological research, driving innovation and accessibility in this fascinating field.</p>

    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <p>My career has been marked by a commitment to multidisciplinary approaches, seamlessly integrating field research with advanced data analysis. My roles have spanned from practical excavation work to the organization of significant academic events. I played a crucial role in the Spring Archaeology conferences of 2020 and 2022, where I managed project development and maintained vital connections with publishers, organizations, and authors. Additionally, I coordinated event planning and meticulously handled the layout and editing of conference materials for publication.</p>

    <h2>Field Work and Research</h2>
    <p>My fieldwork experience includes participating in complex archaeological excavations, thriving in both independent and team settings on pluri-stratified sites. My responsibilities included drafting, reviewing, and organizing comprehensive scientific documentation, such as graphic, photographic, and photogrammetric surveys. I also played a key role in the preparation and conservation of recovered artifacts.</p>

    <p>I provided independent archaeological assistance during the implementation of a water collection network, generating detailed scientific documentation, including historical-archaeological reports and photographic records, while adhering to regulatory standards. My analytical skills were instrumental in examining and interpreting the unearthed materials.</p>

    <p>I also took part in a project that utilized deep learning models to study ancient Egyptian writings. Through segmentation and classification operations, we were able to gain new insights and enhance our understanding of these ancient texts.</p>

    <h2>Skills and Specializations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multidisciplinary Excavations:</strong> Extensive experience in excavating pluri-stratified contexts, from prehistoric to medieval periods, using advanced tools like total stations and specialized software for photogrammetric and topographic surveys.</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific Documentation:</strong> Proficient in compiling, reviewing, and interpreting a wide range of scientific documentation, ensuring accuracy and thoroughness.</li>
        <li><strong>Artifact Conservation:</strong> Expertise in stabilizing, preparing, classifying, and cataloguing archaeological materials to guarantee their optimal preservation and accessibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bridging Archaeology and Data Science</h2>
    <p>My academic and professional journey is driven by a passion for making archaeology a truly multidisciplinary field. By leveraging my background in Data Science, I bring innovative analytical techniques to archaeological research, enhancing the depth and reach of our understanding. Through deep learning, I aim to make archaeological discoveries more insightful and accessible to diverse audiences.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my work. I invite you to explore my projects and connect with me if you share an interest in the dynamic intersection of archaeology and data science.</p>
