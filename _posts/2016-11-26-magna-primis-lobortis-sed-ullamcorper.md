I am a professional with a degree in Archaeology and a second-level Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Statistical Learning. I use deep learning to connect archaeology and data, contributing to making archaeology more multidisciplinary and accessible. My experience includes field research, museum cataloguing, and organizing the Spring Archaeology conferences in 2020 and 2022.
